# Am-I-Dead
A person wakes up with a confused memory of his possible death. Now he has to figure out whether he died or not?

<br>
A game where the player has a memory of him falling down from a building but he does not remember the end part. He is now having illusions that he is dead and he just woke up in his after life but he is not accepting this fact.
In order to know the truth, he starts moving himself, grabbing things and trying to talk to people around him.
This is where he is given some confusing activities to play and determine about his illusion of being dead or alive.
The game design directs the player in multiple directions and it up to the player to chose the one that he thinks is right. Based on playerâ€™s choice, the game play varies and can have multiple outcomes.
